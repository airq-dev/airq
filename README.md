# Airq

![Build](https://github.com/ianhoffman/airq/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg?branch=master)

Airq allows you to recieve information about the air quality near you simply by sending an SMS. While this is FOSS, it does require a bit of setup if you want to run it yourself: you'll need to setup a Twilio account and then deploy this application somewhere. Currently airq is deployed to Amazon ECS, but it could be deployed elsewhere â€” either way, you'll need to setup the necessary infrastructure.


## Features

Airq aggregates sensor readings from nearby [Purpleair](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ijz94dXJ-YAZLi9iZ_RaBwrZ4KtYeCy08goGBwnbCU/edit?usp=sharing) sensors. These sensors are updated every 10 minutes so the results should be fairly accurate, generally. We will soon have a publicly available number to which you can text your zipcode to recieve air quality metrics.


## TODOs

* Register a domain and setup SES to email admins whenever Flask throws an exception.
* Determine which air quality data should actually be public-facing.
* Understand why there are large differences in the air quality as calculated by purpleair and airnow.
* Create a task worker (somewhere? EC2?) to send alerts when air quality changes by a certain amount.
* As a prerequisite to the above task, setup a database in RDS to store phone numbers and zipcodes.
* Write tests (!).


## Contributing

Follow the instructions in the [Local Setup](#local-setup) section. PRs are happily accepted.

You'll want to install [black](https://github.com/psf/black): `pip install 'black==19.10b0'`. Before committing your changes, run `black .` from the repository root to ensure consistent formatting.

You'll also want to install the latest version of [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) and run `mypy app` from the root of this repository before committing.


### Local Setup

To install locally, clone this repo and run `docker-compose up --build`. Test the API by navigating to `http://localhost:5000/quality?zipcode<YOUR ZIPCODE>`. This will return data from both purpleair and airnow. If you want data from just one provider, append `&provider=<purpleair|airnow>` to your request. 

The `/quality` endpoint returns the same message you'd get if you sent a text to a callback registered with Twilio to point at the `/sms_reply` endpoint exposed by this app.
